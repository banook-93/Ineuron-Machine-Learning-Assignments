    "Answer: The process of human learning under the supervision of experts is a way for someone to learn new information or skills with the help of a teacher or expert. The process involves several steps: first, the learner is introduced to new information or skills by the expert. Then, the learner tries to remember what they have learned. Next, the learner practices what they have learned and gets feedback from the expert. After that, the learner is evaluated on what they have learned and gets feedback from the expert again. Finally, the learner puts all the new information or skills they have learned together and the expert helps them understand how it all fits together. The expert helps the learner stay motivated and interested in learning throughout the process."
