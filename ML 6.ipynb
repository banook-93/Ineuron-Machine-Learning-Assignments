    "K-fold cross-validation is a widely used technique to assess the performance of a machine learning model while maximizing data utilization. It involves dividing the data into k subsets (folds) and systematically rotating through them for training and testing. Here's a detailed explanation in bullet points:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is first randomly shuffled to ensure that the data points are not biased in any specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire dataset is divided into k roughly equal-sized subsets (folds) of approximately the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins with selecting one fold as the test set and the remaining k-1 folds as the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set. The evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) is recorded for this iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is then repeated k times, each time choosing a different fold as the test set while the rest serve as the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all k iterations are completed, the k evaluation metrics are averaged to obtain a single performance metric for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of k-fold cross-validation is that each data point appears in the test set exactly once, and the model's performance is assessed using all available data, providing a more reliable estimate of the model's generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common choices for the value of k are 5 and 10, but the value can be adjusted depending on the size of the dataset and computational resources available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once cross-validation is completed, the final model can be trained on the entire dataset using the best hyperparameters and evaluated on a separate test set (not used during cross-validation) to estimate its performance in the real world."
