We call it as night time) , building a theory (model) to explain this pattern (Day/Night is a function of Rotation of Earth on its axis) and testing this theory to check if it fits in most or all observations."

However, it can also be challenging as it requires a great deal of self-motivation and self-direction, and may not be suitable for everyone. Additionally, the lack of direct guidance and feedback from a teacher or mentor can make it difficult to identify and correct mistakes or gaps in understanding."
